# webxr-experiment
A brief foray into dynamic VR animation using Godot.

A still untitled piece, this procedural dynamic animation is a personal reflection on systems and societies, focusing on the dangers of simplified models. Inspired by the catastrophe of No Child Left Behind (giving entire grace and assuming complete positive intentions around that policy), I hope to inspire consideration of unpredictable side effects and the significance of an inclusion of diversity of thought & experiences. This is particularly important for white men, who, within much of the West, predominantly serve in the positions of power and, when they care about others, are particularly susceptible to the white savior complex and additional issues from masculinity: as soon as "if we simply did ___" is heard, red flags should be raised. As this piece shows, looking ahead (above) or behind (below), patterns within our societal structures can be recognized, and we might assume we know where things are going or what effects things will have. But looking up close for long enough, one will realize that their initial ideas are wrong, as the unpredictable results from the complexity of the system arises: even with such simple black and white thinking. We need to come together, elevate historically unheard voices, and collaboratively strategize and build our societies, rejecting our past approach of monolithic white patriarchy.
